## Introduction

**StudyWS** is a web and mobile application that helps high school and university students manage and organize their learning journey. It enables users to create, edit, and manage notes and learning resources within a structured workspace, while integrating document versioning and AI-based microservices for automated learning-content generation. 

The project represents an education-focused alternative to tools such as Notion and NotebookLM, supporting end-to-end study workflow: from automatic lecture transcription to the generation of flashcards, as well as the automated creation of questions, quizzes, and summaries to facilitate review and retention. 

## Project Context and Objectives
### Project Vision

StudyWS borns from the need to join modern study tools into a single, integrated platform. 
The platform is intended to provide centralized management of notes and documents, voice-based content acquisition (lecture transcription), and the automated generation of review materials. 

### Primary Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **End-to-end architecture** | Design and implement a complete and scalable client–server–database system. |
| **RESTful backend** | Develop REST APIs to manage core application data and operations. |
| **Document version control** | Implement a versioning mechanism that tracks document evolution over time. |
| **AI microservices** | Divide AI capabilities (e.g., transcription, summarization, flashcard generation) into dedicated Python microservices. |
| **Modern mobile client** | Deliver a responsive and user-friendly mobile client. |
