## Bugs & feature requests

Before opening a new Issue:
- Check existing Issues to avoid duplicates.
- Use a clear title and include context.

When opening an Issue, please include:
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior.
- Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug).
- Environment details (OS, browser, versions, logs when available).
- Screenshots / short clips if helpful.

## Code contributions (Pull Requests)

### Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `main`:
    - `feat/<short-description>` for new features
    - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
    - `docs/<short-description>` for documentation
    - `chore/<short-description>` for maintenance/refactors
3. Keep the PR focused: one topic per PR.
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of what changed and why.

### Commit message guidance
Prefer concise, descriptive messages, for example:
- `feat: add ...`
- `fix: handle ...`
- `docs: update ...`
- `refactor: simplify ...`
- `chore: ...`

> Tip: If your change is large or touches architecture/APIs, open an Issue first to discuss the approach.

## Pull Request checklist 

Before requesting review:
- [ ] PR title + description explain **what** changed and **why**.
- [ ] You tested locally (as applicable).
- [ ] Docs were updated if behavior/usage changed.
- [ ] No secrets or personal data are committed (tokens, passwords, private URLs).
- [ ] The PR is scoped (avoid unrelated formatting-only changes).

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public Issue.
Contact the maintainer privately (email) with details and steps to reproduce.

## Community guidelines 🤝
